Meet 'Mirza' (Amitabh Bachchan) - a 78yrs old landlord, who would move heaven and earth for his most prized possession - an old dilapidated mansion in the heart of Lucknow. But this garden of roses comes with its own cluster of 'pricky thorns' - tenants. Amongst them most prominently, 'Baankey' (Ayushmann Khuranna)' a shrewd, sly and squatted tenant, who matches Mirza bit for a bit in their ceaseless bantering. Gulabo Sitabo is a quirky slice of life where Mirza and Baankey are like Tom and Jerry - unique and unmatched, friend and foe, naughty and smart, little and large, all combine to produce chaos.",
