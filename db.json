      "summary": "Welcome to the world of Gulabo Sitabo where two slimy scheming foxes in a game of one-upmanship, each one attracting other members to their clan and each one with an agenda of his own. Meet 'Mirza' (Amitabh Bachchan) - a 78yrs old landlord, who would move heaven and earth for his most prized possession - an old dilapidated mansion in the heart of Lucknow. But this garden of roses comes with its own cluster of 'pricky thorns' - tenants. Amongst them most prominently, 'Baankey' (Ayushmann Khuranna)' a shrewd, sly and squatted tenant, who matches Mirza bit for a bit in their ceaseless bantering. Gulabo Sitabo is a quirky slice of life where Mirza and Baankey are like Tom and Jerry - unique and unmatched, friend and foe, naughty and smart, little and large, all combine to produce chaos.",
